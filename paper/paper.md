# Acknowledgements

I acknowledge very helpful discussions with my PostDoc supervisor Prof. Jacob Linder when learning the BdG formalism as well as on superconductivity in general. I also acknowledge some useful discussions with Morten Amundsen, Henning G. Hugdal, and Sol H. Jacobsen on tight-binding modeling in general.

This work was supported by the Research Council of Norway through Grant No. 323766 and its Centres of Excellence funding scheme Grant No. 262633 "QuSpin." During the development of this package, some numerical calculations were performed on resources provided by Sigma2 â€“ the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and Data Storage in Norway, Project No. NN9577K. The work presented in this paper has also benefited from the Experimental Infrastructure for Exploration of Exascale Computing (eX3), which is financially supported by the Research Council of Norway under contract 270053.
