# Documentation
Modern development practices:
- [ ] Type hints for core libraries
- [ ] Docstrings for all classes/functions in core libraries
- [ ] Beartype for runtime type checking of all core libraries
- [ ] Pytest for unit testing of all core functionality
- [ ] GitHub actions for continuous integration (ensuring that it works across Python 3.9-3.11)
