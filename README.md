# Development branch

You have found the old development branch of Bodge. Feel free to look
around, but keep in mind that the code you find here is not meant for use
by others and may be undocumented, untested, broken, buggy, or even wrong.

Most users should probably head over to the [main branch][main] instead.

Since the `main` branch went through some serious refactoring before Bodge
was uploaded to PyPI and submitted to JOSS, much of the code here is quite
outdated as well. New development of `bodge` now happens in feature branches.
