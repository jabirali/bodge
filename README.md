# Bodge

Bodge is a linear-scaling solver for megadimensional tight-binding models.
Although quite general tight-binding models are supported, we especially
target the BOgoliubov-DeGEnnes equation for ballistic superconductivity,
which is where the name comes from. The solver is implemented in Python,
and is based on the Local Chebyshev expansion of the Green function.
