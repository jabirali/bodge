"""Calculate the generalized RKKY interactions on a superconductor.

The model system is two magentic impurities deposited on a superconductor. We
here wish to compare the responses of various p-wave superconductors with both
s-wave superconductors and normal metals. Moreover, we are here interested in
analyzing both the conventional contributions to the RKKY interaction, and
whether some DMI-like terms might arise e.g. in non-unitary situations.
