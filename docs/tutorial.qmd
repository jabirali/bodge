  Bodge is a Python package for constructing large real-space tight-binding
  models. Although quite general tight-binding models can be constructed, we
  focus on the Bogoliubov-DeGennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian, which is used to
  model superconductivity in clean materials. So if you want a lattice model
  for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is efficient yet
  easy to use, then you've come to the right place.
