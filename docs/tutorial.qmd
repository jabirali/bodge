## About

Please note that this tutorial is auto-generated from literate MarkDown files using Quarto. If you install Quarto, the docs can be regenerated by running `make docs` from the code repository.

## Installation

## Quickstart
The main purpose of this package is to streamline calculations associated with BdG modeling of superconductivity. Let's therefore kick off the tutorial with a simple and mostly self-explanatory example of that usage, before we move on to more thorough documentation.

Test of equations:
$$\mathcal{H} = -t \sum_{ij} c^\dagger_i c_j$$

## Lattices



## Hamiltonians

## Material database
### Normal metal
```{python}
from bodge import *

lattice = CubicLattice((32, 32, 1))
system = Hamiltonian(lattice)

t = 1.0
μ = 2.0

with system as (H, Δ):
  for i in lattice.sites():
    H[i, i] = (μ - 4*t) * σ0
  for i, j in lattice.bonds():
    H[i, j] = -t * σ0

H = system(format="dense")
```
Note the presence of Greek letters in the source code. I personally find that keeping the source code close to the notation used in physics makes the code easier to read and reason about. If you agree, nearly every modern editor has a way to enter such symbols. If you disagree, you can simply write out `sigma0` instead of `σ0` above.

### Superconductors
Main reason to use it...

### Ferromagnets

### Altermagnets
