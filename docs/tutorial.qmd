## Installation

## Basic usage
### Normal metal
```{python}
from bodge import *

lattice = CubicLattice((32, 32, 1))
system = Hamiltonian(lattice)

t = 1.0
μ = 2.0

with system as (H, Δ):
  for i in lattice.sites():
    H[i, i] = (μ - 4*t) * σ0
  for i, j in lattice.bonds():
    H[i, j] = -t * σ0

H = system(format="dense")
```
