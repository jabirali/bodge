class Cubic:
	"""Representation of a cubic atomic lattice in three dimensions.

	This class provides convenience methods for iterating over all sites
	or neighbors in a lattice, as well as methods for converting between
	index (i1, i2) and coordinate ((x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2)) notations.
	This simplifies the process of preparing lattice Hamiltonian matrices
	using flat indices while retaining the convenience of coordinates.
