	systems with particle-hole and spin degrees of freedom. Instead of
	explicitly constructing the matrix, this class allows you to specify the
	minimum number of matrix elements required via a `with` block, and the
	the rest are autofilled via symmetries. Moreover, it allows you to use
	`Lattice` coordinates instead of matrix indices to fill out the elements.

	Internally, this constructs a block-sparse matrix (BSR format), enabling
