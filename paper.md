# Summary

[Bodge](https://github.com/jabirali/bodge) is Python package for constructing large-scale real-space tight-binding models. "Large-scale" means that it uses sparse matrices to scale well to lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in e.g. momentum space. Although quite general tight-binding models can be constructed using this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-DeGennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian which is used to model superconductivity in the clean limit. The package is designed to be extensible and flexible, and can easily be used to model heterostructures containing e.g. conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism and spin-orbit coupling, etc.

In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, I believe that Bodge is a good choice. See [@ouassou_alt_2023; @ouassou_rkky_2024; @ouassou_dmi_2024] for examples of research papers where Bodge has been applied.

# Acknowledgements

I acknowledge very helpful discussions with my PostDoc supervisor Prof. Jacob Linder when learning the BdG formalism as well as on superconductivity in general. I also acknowledge some useful discussions with Morten Amundsen, Henning G. Hugdal, and Sol H. Jacobsen on tight-binding modeling in general.
