# Summary

[Bodge](https://github.com/jabirali/bodge) is Python package for constructing *large-scale real-space tight-binding models* for calculations in condensed matter physics. "Large-scale" means that it should remain performant even for lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in e.g. momentum space.

Although general tight-binding models can be constructed with this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-DeGennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian used to model superconductivity in the clean limit [@zhu_bdg_2016; @degennes_bdg_1966]. The package is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and extensible – and very few lines of code are required to model heterostructures containing e.g. conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism and spin-orbit coupling, etc.

In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, Bodge should be a good choice.

# Statement of need

In condensed matter physics, a standard methodology for modeling materials is the *tight-binding model*. In the context of electronic systems (e.g. metals), the electrons in such a model typically "live" at one atomic site, but from time to time "hop" over to neighboring atoms. By including a spin structure as well in this formalism – meaning that we keep track of what spins each electron has, and whether the spins "flip" during various interactions that are permitted on this lattice – we can model a wide variety of physical phenomena including superconductivity and magnetism. Mathematically, this is often expressed in the language of quantum field theory: We define one operator $c^\dagger_{i\sigma}$ that "puts" an electron with spin $\sigma \in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ on an atomic site with some index $i$, and another operator $c_{i\sigma}$ that "removes" a corresponding electron. The Hamiltonian operator $\mathcal{H}$ of the system is then constructed out of these electron operators – and this can in turn be used to calculate e.g. the ground-state energy, electric currents, superconducting order parameters, and other relevant material properties.

To do anything useful with that Hamiltonian *on a computer*, however, you typically have to translate it to a matrix form. This is where Bodge enters the picture:

- It provides an easy-to-use Pythonic interface for constructing the Hamiltonian of a tight-binding system. Particular focus has been placed on making it easy to describe systems that include various forms of superconductivity and magnetism, making it a great choice for modeling e.g. superconductivity in magnetic heterostructures.
- It scales well to large systems. For efficiency, it uses SciPy sparse matrices internally [@scipy_2020], and it constructs large Hamiltonians in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and memory where $N$ is the number of sites. According to [my benchmarks](https://jabirali.github.io/bodge/tutorial.html#numerical-details), the performance is similar to [Kwant](https://kwant-project.org/) [@groth_kwant_2014], which is the state of the art for numerical condensed matter physics. The results can be returned in most NumPy or SciPy matrix formats.
- It is designed to be extensible. For instance, while Bodge currently only implements square and cubic lattices (via the `CubicLattice` class), it can be used to construct Hamiltonians on e.g. triangular or hexagonal lattices if you want: you just need to subclass `Lattice` and implement 2-3 short iterators that describe your lattice.
- Some convenience methods are provided to help you with the next steps of your calculations: Extracting the local density of states (LDOS), calculating the free energy, diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, etc. (Some more advanced algorithms live on the `develop` branch on GitHub, but have not yet been assimilated into official packages.)
- The code itself follows modern software development practices: Full test coverage with continuous integration (via `pytest`), fast runtime type checking (via `beartype`), and PEP-8 compliance (via `black`).

There are two main alternatives that arguably fill a similar niche to Bodge: Kwant [@groth_kwant_2014] and Pybinding [@moldovan_pybinding_2020]. Compared to these packages, the main benefit of Bodge is the focus on the BdG Hamiltonian in particular. For instance, using Kwant, it is up to the user to declare that each lattice site has 4 degrees of freedom (spin-up electrons, spin-down electrons, spin-up holes, and spin-down holes), and to ensure that you construct a Hamiltonian with the correct particle-hole symmetries. Bodge, however, *assumes* that these are the only relevant degrees of freedom, and enforces the relevant symmetries by default. In practice, this means that Kwant can be used to study a broader variety of physical systems, whereas Bodge can provide a friendlier syntax for users who work specifically on superconducting systems. Both packages support both NumPy arrays and SciPy sparse matrices as output formats, and both provide similar performance in the limit of large systems.

*Sparse matrix formats*, such as e.g. the *Compressed Sparse Row* (CSR) format used in the example below, have the advantage that they basically only store the non-zero elements of a matrix. In the case of a typical tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping terms, the Hamiltonian matrix of a system of $N$ atoms has $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ elements where only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ are actually non-zero. Thus, algorithms that leverage sparse matrices often result in at least an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ numerical speed-up, which becomes highly significant for large systems. With additional approximations, even larger speed-ups can in some cases be possible [@nagai_krylov_2020], although it depends on your system size and the strength of its interactions whether such approximations provide a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, *dense matrices* (i.e. NumPy arrays) allow for simpler solution algorithms based on e.g. full matrix diagonalization, and can become faster than sparse matrix algorithms for small systems or when leveraging GPU calculations. For this reason, both sparse and dense matrices are fully supported by Bodge, allowing the user to pick the most suitable matrix format for the task at hand.

# Examples and workflows

Introductory examples of how to use Bodge are provided in the [official documentation](https://jabirali.github.io/bodge/). Examples of research problems that have been studied using Bodge include superconductor/altermagnet heterostructures [@ouassou_alt_2023] and RKKY interactions in unconventional superconductors [@ouassou_rkky_2024; @ouassou_dmi_2024]. These papers also describe some sparse matrix algorithms that have been used to speed up numerical calculations based on Bodge, including Chebyshev expansion of the Fermi matrix [@ouassou_alt_23; @weisse_chebyshev_2006; @benfenati_fermi_2022; @goedecker_fermi_1994] and a quick way to calculate the local density of states [@ouassou_rkky_24; @nagai_ldos_2017].

For a simple example of how this package can be used, consider a $64a\times64a$ square lattice. Let's assume that the whole system is a metal with chemical potential $\mu = 1.5t$, where $t=1$ is the hopping amplitude. Moreover, let's assume that half the system ($x < 32a$) is a conventional $s$-wave superconductor with an order parameter $\Delta_s = 0.1t$, whereas the other half is a ferromagnet with exchange field $\mathbf{M} = M_z \mathbf{e}_z$. To construct the Hamiltonian matrix for such a system in the CSR sparse format, we can use the following code:
```python
from bodge import *

# Tight-binding parameters
t = 1
μ = 1.5 * t
Δs = 0.1 * t
Mz = 0.5 * Δs

# Construct the Hamiltonian
lattice = CubicLattice((64, 64, 1))
system = Hamiltonian(lattice)

with system as (H, Δ):
    for i, j in lattice.bonds():
        H[i, j] = -t * σ0
    for i in lattice.sites():
        if i[0] < 32:
            H[i, i] = -μ * σ0
            Δ[i, i] = -Δs * jσ2
        else:
            H[i, i] = -μ * σ0 - Mz * σ3
```
Note the use of a context manager (`with`-block) to provide an intuitive array syntax for accessing the relevant parts of the Hamiltonian matrix, while abstracting away the underlying sparse matrix details. Afterwards, there are several different ways to use the resulting `Hamiltonian` object.

Some physical observables can be directly calculated using the methods provided in Bodge. For instance, one can use the method `system.ldos` to directly calculate the local density of states, which can then be used to check for spectral features such as e.g. a *superconducting gap* or a *zero-energy peak*. There is also a method `system.free_energy` which calculates the *free energy* of the system. By varying parameters in the Hamiltonian (e.g. the orientation of a magnetic field) and then minimizing this free energy, one can e.g. determine the ground state of the system.

Most calculations of interest, however, requires that the user implements some code themselves. There are then two main approaches one can take. The classic approach is *matrix diagonalization* which uses dense matrices internally. Bodge provides the method `diagonalize` for this purpose:
```python
E, X = system.diagonalize()
```
The results above contain the positive energies $E_n$ and corresponding  $\mathbf{X}_n$ which satisfy the eigenvalue equation $\mathbf{H} \mathbf{X}_n = E_n \mathbf{X}_n$. (Only positive eigenvalues are returned due to the so-called "Nambu doubling" of degrees of freedom in superconducting systems.) Once the eigenvalues and eigenvectors have been obtained, the user can themselves calculate physical properties of interest from on these using equations from standard textbooks on the "Bogoliubov–de Gennes" approach to modeling superconductivity [@zhu_bdg_2016]. It is a future goal to incorporate more calculation methods of this kind into the Bodge package itself. Moreover, support for matrix diagonalization using GPUs (via the CuPy package) is currently under development since it offers orders of magnitude faster computation when the right hardware is available.

Examples of physical observables that can be calculated from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors include e.g. the superconducting order parameter, electric currents, and spin currents. Indirectly, these can in turn be used to calculate even more physical observables. For instance, the critical current of a Josephson junction can be defined as the largest electric current that can flow through it for any phase difference, and the critical temperature of a bulk superconductor can be defined as the largest temperature at which the superconducting order parameter remains non-zero.

A modern alternative to matrix diagonalization is a series of algorithms based on Chebyshev expansion of the Hamiltonian matrix [@ouassou_alt_2023; @benfenati_fermi_2022; @covaci_cbdg_2010; @nagai_krylov_2020; @weisse_chebyshev_2006]. These algorithms take advantage of the extreme sparsity of the Hamiltonian matrix, and thus typically provide a performance benefit for very large lattices. One of the main design goals behind Bodge has been to make it trivial to construct sparse representations of the Hamiltonian matrix for this purpose, and it is therefore straight-forward to export the result as e.g. a CSR matrix:
```python
H = system.matrix(format="csr")
```
The user can then easily use the resulting matrix $\mathbf{H}$ to formulate their own sparse matrix algorithms of this kind.
