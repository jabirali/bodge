# Summary

[Bodge](https://github.com/jabirali/bodge) is Python package for constructing *large-scale real-space tight-binding models* for calculations in condensed matter physics. "Large-scale" means that it uses SciPy sparse matrices [@scipy_2020] to scale to lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in e.g. momentum space.

Although general tight-binding models can be constructed with this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-DeGennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian which is used to model superconductivity in the clean limit [@zhu_bdg_2016; @degennes_bdg_1966]. The package is designed to be extensible and flexible, and can easily be used to model heterostructures containing e.g. conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism and spin-orbit coupling, etc. In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, I believe that Bodge is a good choice.

# Examples

Introductory examples of how to use Bodge are provided in the [official documentation](https://jabirali.github.io/bodge/). Examples of research problems that have been studied using Bodge include superconductor/altermagnet heterostructures [@ouassou_alt_2023] and RKKY interactions in unconventional superconductors [@ouassou_rkky_2024; @ouassou_dmi_2024].

# Acknowledgements

I acknowledge very helpful discussions with my PostDoc supervisor Prof. Jacob Linder when learning the BdG formalism as well as on superconductivity in general. I also acknowledge some useful discussions with Morten Amundsen, Henning G. Hugdal, and Sol H. Jacobsen on tight-binding modeling in general.
