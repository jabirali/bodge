# Summary

[Bodge](https://github.com/jabirali/bodge) is Python package for constructing *large-scale real-space tight-binding models* for calculations in condensed matter physics. "Large-scale" means that it should remain performant even for lattices with millions of atoms, and "real-space" means that the model is formulated in terms of individual lattice sites and not in e.g. momentum space.

Although general tight-binding models can be constructed with this package, the main focus is on the Bogoliubov-DeGennes ("BoDGe") Hamiltonian used to model superconductivity in the clean limit [@zhu_bdg_2016; @degennes_bdg_1966]. The package is designed to be easy to use, flexible, and extensible – and very few lines of code are required to model heterostructures containing e.g. conventional and unconventional superconductors, ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnetism and spin-orbit coupling, etc.

In other words: If you want a lattice model for superconducting nanostructures, and want something that is computationally efficient yet easy to use, Bodge should be a good choice.

# Statement of need

In condensed matter physics, a standard methodology for modeling materials is the *tight-binding model*. In the context of electronic systems (e.g. metals), the electrons in such a model typically "live" at one atomic site, but from time to time "hop" over to neighboring atoms. By including a spin structure as well in this formalism – meaning that we keep track of what spins each electron has, and whether the spins "flip" during various interactions that are permitted on this lattice – we can model a wide variety of physical phenomena including superconductivity and magnetism. Mathematically, this is often expressed in the language of quantum field theory: We define one operator $c^\dagger_{i\sigma}$ that "puts" an electron with spin $\sigma \in \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ on an atomic site with some index $i$, and another operator $c_{i\sigma}$ that "removes" a corresponding electron. The Hamiltonian operator $\mathcal{H}$ of the system is then constructed out of these electron operators – and this can in turn be used to calculate e.g. the ground-state energy, electric currents, superconducting order parameters, and properties of interest.

To do anything useful with that Hamiltonian *on a computer*, however, you typically have to translate it to a matrix form. This is where Bodge enters the picture:

- It provides an easy-to-use Pythonic interface for constructing the Hamiltonian of a tight-binding system. Particular focus has been placed on making it easy to describe systems that include various forms of superconductivity and magnetism, making it a great choice for modeling e.g. superconductivity in magnetic heterostructures.
- It scales well to large systems. For efficiency, it uses SciPy sparse matrices internally [@scipy_2020], and it constructs large Hamiltonians in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and memory where $N$ is the number of sites. According to [my benchmarks](https://jabirali.github.io/bodge/tutorial.html#numerical-details), the performance is similar to [Kwant](https://kwant-project.org/) [@groth_kwant_2014], which is the state of the art for numerical condensed matter physics. The results can be returned in most NumPy or SciPy matrix formats.
- It is designed to be extensible. For instance, while Bodge currently only implements square and cubic lattices (via the `CubicLattice` class), it can be used to construct Hamiltonians on e.g. triangular or hexagonal lattices if you want: you just need to subclass `Lattice` and implement 2-3 short iterators that describe what your lattice looks like.
- Some convenience methods are provided to help you with the next steps of your calculations: Extracting the local density of states (LDOS), calculating the free energy, diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, etc. (Some more advanced algorithms live on the `development` branch, but have not yet been assimilated into the `main` branch.)
- The code itself follows modern software development practices: Full test coverage with continuous integration (via `pytest`), fast runtime type checking (via `beartype`), and PEP-8 compliance (via `black`).

There are two main alternatives that arguably fill the same niche as Bodge: Kwant [@groth_kwant_2014] and Pybinding [@moldovan_pybinding_2020].

# Examples

Introductory examples of how to use Bodge are provided in the [official documentation](https://jabirali.github.io/bodge/). Examples of research problems that have been studied using Bodge include superconductor/altermagnet heterostructures [@ouassou_alt_2023] and RKKY interactions in unconventional superconductors [@ouassou_rkky_2024; @ouassou_dmi_2024].
