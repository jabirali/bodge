class Chebyshev:
    """This class facilitates a Chebyshev expansion of Green functions.

    Specifically, it calculates the scaled function `a(ω) = A(ω) / Nπ sqrt(1-ω²)`,
    where `A(ω) = [Gᴬ(ω) - Gᴿ(ω)] / 2πi` is the spectral function. This is defined
    such that summing up the `a(ω_k)` at the Chebyshev nodes `ω_k` is equivalent
    to integrating `A(ω)` over the same range. This is useful for calculating e.g.
    an order parameter or current, but when spectral quantities such as the
    density of states are desired, this requires a scaling by `Nπ sqrt(1-ω²)`.

    The `radius` determines the size of the Local Krylov subspace used for the
    expansion, `moments` sets the number of Chebyshev matrices to include in
    the expansion, and `system` provides a previously configured Hamiltonian.
