    """Representation of a physical system in the tight-binding limit.

    This class can be used to construct Hamiltonian matrices for condensed
    matter systems with particle-hole and spin degrees of freedom. Instead of
    explicitly constructing the whole matrix, this class allows you to specify
    the minimum number of matrix elements required via a `with` block, and the
    the remainder is autofilled via symmetries. Moreover, it allows you to use
    lattice coordinates instead of matrix indices to fill out these elements.

    Internally, this constructs a block-sparse matrix (BSR format), enabling
    the construction of megadimensional tight-binding systems (>10^6 sites).
