    We define the resolvent operator as [(ε+iη)I - H] R(ε) = I, which can be
    divided into vectors R(ε) = [r_1 ... r_N] and I = [e_1 ... e_N]. Diagonal
    elements of the resolvent matrix correspond to the density of states. By
    calculating one vector at a time via a sparse linear solver `spsolve`, the
    local density of states can be efficiently calculated at specific points.

    calculate the density of states, since electron-hole symmetry is used to
    get the negative-energy solutions in an efficient manner.

    This is done by computing all the positive eigenvalues ε_n of the matrix,

    the internal energy (calculated from ɛ_n), T is the provided temperature,

    The argument `cuda` can be used to turn on GPU calculations, which
    can be several orders of magnitude faster if you have an NVIDIA GPU.

    Note that in general, U should also have a constant contribution, which
    corresponds to the non-matrix parts to the Hamiltonian operator. These
    implicitly depend on e.g. all mean fields in the system. We can neglect
    these contributions when doing non-selfconsistent calculations. But if you

    you calculate this constant and add it to the return value of this function.
