"""Critical temperature for s-wave superconductors with a magnetic defect.

The scenarios considered here correspond to a superconductor in contact
with a magnetic insulator, such that the electron flow inside the magnet
can be neglected. This way, we can approximate it as an effective exchange
field inside the superconductor (with a corresponding magnetic texture).
